    "## Unit testing strategy with DLT\n",
    "\n",
    "Delta Live Table logic can be unit tested leveraging Expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, the DLT pipelines can be constructed as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ingestion step (first step of the pipeline on the left) is written in a separate notebook. This correspond to the left **green** (prod) and **blue** (test) input sources.\n",
    "   * The Production pipeline is defined with the PROD ingestion notebook:[./ingestion_profile/DLT-ingest_prod]($./ingestion_profile/DLT-ingest_prod) and connects to the live datasource (ex: kafka server, staging blob storage)\n",
    "   * The Test pipeline (only used to run the unit test) is defined with the TEST ingestion notebook: [./ingestion_profile/DLT-ingest_test]($./ingestion_profile/DLT-ingest_test) and can consume from local files used for our unit tests (ex: adhoc csv file)\n",
    "* A common DLT pipeline logic is used for both the prod and the test pipeline (the **yellow** in the graph)\n",
    "* An additional notebook containing all the unit tests is used in the TEST pipeline (the **blue `TEST_xxx` tables** in the image on the right side)\n",
